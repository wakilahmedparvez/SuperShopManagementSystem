# SuperShopManagementSystem with Cryptography
Super Shop Management System with Caesar Cipher Encryption in C

 # Project Description

A simple yet functional Super Shop Management System developed in C that demonstrates basic cryptography principles using Caesar Cipher to secure user credentials.

This project integrates:

Admin Operations: Add products, show products, update stock, search products

Customer Operations: View products, billing

Cryptography: Username and password encrypted using Caesar Cipher (shift = 3)

# Key Learning / Skills Practiced

Implementation of Caesar Cipher encryption & decryption

Understanding secure authentication

Role-based access control (Admin vs Customer)

Basics of data protection in software systems

Structuring a small C project with multiple modules/functions

# Technologies Used

C Programming

Standard Input/Output

Arrays & Structs

String Manipulation

Why This Project Matters

Even though Caesar Cipher is a classical encryption method, this project helped me understand foundations of cryptography, secure coding practices, and how to handle sensitive data in software systems — essential skills in Cyber Security.
